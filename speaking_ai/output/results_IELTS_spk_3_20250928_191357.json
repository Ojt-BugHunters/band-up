Chasing big goals often means sacrificing time with friends or family, which can leave them isolated, especially if they're workaholics. For example, a CEO might have all the accolades but miss out on casual hangouts, you know, because their schedule's packed. On the flip side, success can also attract shallow connections, making it hard to find genuine relationships. I believe loneliness creeps in when success overshadows balance, but it's not a universal rule.",
