  "essay_text": "\n    In certain countries, employers are legally prohibited from discriminating against job applicants on the basis of age. In my view, although the policy aims to foster fairness and equal opportunity, the potential drawbacks in real-world application may outweigh its intended benefits.\n\n    It is true that banning age-based discrimination can promote fairness and equal opportunity in the labour market. One key advantage is that it encourages a diverse and inclusive workforce. Applicants of different ages—whether younger or older—can offer unique skills, experiences, and perspectives that enhance workplace collaboration. As a result, fair hiring practices help build stronger team dynamics and foster innovation. Another benefit is that this policy helps reduce social inequality, particularly for older individuals. Many experienced professionals, for instance, are unfairly rejected due to age, even when they possess valuable expertise. By protecting them from discrimination, anti-age laws allow for extended careers and improved financial security later in life.\n\n    However, enforcing such regulations may come with practical limitations which undermine their intended benefits.. One notable  issue is that employers might still find indirect ways to discriminate. Bias can persist during interviews, or companies may use coded language in job advertisements to subtly exclude certain age groups. Consequently, legal protection alone may not be sufficient to eliminate age-related prejudice in hiring practices. Another concern is that certain jobs have physical requirements that may not align with all applicants' capabilities. For example, roles involving manual labour or high physical endurance may be less suitable for older candidates. In such cases, mandatory inclusion could result in mismatches between workers and job demands, potentially affecting performance and safety.\n\n    In conclusion, while making age-based discrimination illegal in hiring is a positive step toward fairness and equality, its effectiveness is limited by enforcement challenges and the persistence of implicit bias.\n    ",
